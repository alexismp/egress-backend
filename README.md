Train Station (Egress)
======================

Implementing a web and mobile game with Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.

This project provides an App Engine backend used for the Egress game play (mainly resetting station owners) and game analytics (via continuous log export to BigQuery). This is a Maven project which can be used in your favorite IDE (including Android Studio!).

The train stations are from this French government Open Data set: [Gares ferroviaires de tous types, exploit√©es ou non](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/gares-ferroviaires-de-tous-types-exploitees-ou-non/)

**This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.**
